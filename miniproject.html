		    <p>Hi, I'm Tej Patel. I'm currently a sophomore, majoring in computer science and minoring in informatics. In this website, I will talk about two different specializations in computer science and will focus on explaining what they are about, job opportunities, and why I chose these two.</p>
		        <hr />
			    <center><h2><u>Specialty Areas</u></h2></center>
			        <ol>
				        <li><h3>Programming Languages</h3></li>
					      <p>Programming languages are languages that give machines instructions about how to satisfy the set goal. There are many different programming languages, similar to languages spoken, each with specific syntax. The first programming language created was FORTRAN in 1957 by John Backus (Fitzpatrick). This language is still used today and was developed to solve scientific calculations. The most recent language created was Ruby in 2005 by David Heinemeir (Fitzpatrick). It is rapidly becoming a popular language.</p>
					                      <p>The job outlook for a programmer is best with knowledge of many different languages. Some of the popular languages used last year were Java, PHP, C++, and C ("pyDatalog"). Many of the top companies in the world use programming languages.</p>
							                      <p>An Amazon programmer would continue to develop and expand what Amazon has already developed. Programmers typically work in teams and sometimes alone depending on the extent of the project. They would work on the cloud player, cloud drive, search, and apps for Android phones ("amazon"). </p>
									                      <p>I chose programming languages because I enjoyed writing code in the programming classes I had already taken. Also, my intended major is computer science and my specialization is this. It was fascinating to learn the volume of projects developed by just one company.</p>

													                  <li><h3>Systems</h3></li>
															              <p>System is the interaction between the user and the computer. Information is sent to a computer for the purpose of accomplishing all the tasks.There are many various subclasses of systems. The most important one is information technologies. It enables humans to solve problems that are difficult for a typical person to compute ("Wikipedia").</p>
																                      <p>Information technology is used everyday, all around us. Many businesses use a transaction processing system. It collects, modifies, and retrieves all the transaction data (Janssen). The system still needs some minor improvements to reduce the errors that occur.</p>
																		                      <p>Continuing on transaction processing system, it is designed for sales transactions. They are used in many digital cash registers, credit card processors, inventory databases, and accounting software (Ingram). They compute the total transactions and total sales to formulate a batch.
																					                <p>I chose this specialization because I was interested in the components of systems. I found it interesting that systems is mostly used everywhere and by everyone. Because of the aforementioned, this is still a developing field and would like to see how much it expands in the next few years.</p>
